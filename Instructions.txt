As discussed we're going to have you do some skills tests as listed below.  We can give you an FTP login, but if you have your own PHP environment/website or have XAMPP installed (great dev tool anyway) that would be better in this case since we have all sorts of firewall/VPN rules that make it complicated.
 

The attached data dump has two tables (part of our punchout ecommerce system).  You can assume v7 or 8 for PHP.  Please use procedural style coding and mysqli functions in PHP when querying the data in [1] below.
 

[1] Do a basic CRUD for the products table, it can be a simple table interface.  Display the category name in the column (it does not have to be editable, just display it since it's in another table - products links to categories by category_level1_code).  Make the header columns sortable links so if you click "product_title" it sorts A-Z, and if you click it again, Z-A.  You can use whatever output you want (bootstrap, etc.), thatâ€™s less important than actual parsing of data.
 

[2] I want you to parse the attached XML (cxml_po_sample.xml) with the built in PHP simpleXML functions.
 

Parse each element and attribute into a variable and then put it into an multi-dimensional array and sort alphabetically by the element names.
 

Output all elements of the array in a loop.
 

[3] Convert the cXML PO to JSON and then loop over that the same way, but using built in PHP JSON functions vs. simplexml. 
 

Make sure you comment your code (more comments are better!).
 

Let us know approximately how long this took you to do as a metric on our side.
